# Platformer-vs-Puzzle-Matura
Matura Project data and code

# Abstract
This study investigates the cognitive effects of puzzle and platformer video games on reaction
time, visual memory, and verbal memory. Utilising a controlled experimental design, partici-
pants underwent cognitive tests before and after playing designated games over six weeks. Re-
sults indicate that platformer games significantly enhance reaction time (average improvement:
11.97ms), attributed to their dynamic, fast-paced gameplay. Conversely, puzzle games demon-
strated superior effects on both visual (average improvement: 0.6 levels) and verbal memory
(average improvement: 4.51 words), due to their reliance on object recognition and linguistic
association. These findings highlight the potential of video games as tools for targeted cognitive
enhancement, with platformers excelling in reaction-time improvements and puzzles in
memory-related tasks. However, limitations such as the small sample size, short gaming
sessions, and a lack of participant diversity restrict the generalisability of these results. Future
research should explore these effects over longer durations and across broader populations to
validate and extend these findings.
